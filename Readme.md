## Overlay

Thanks to the awesome guys from [birchwoodstudioandevents.com](birchwoodstudioandevents.com) you can even get an awesome overlay for your XTouch controller.

This is a magnetic overlay that you can add on your XTouch so you don't have to remember all the mappings.

You can buy it on their website by clicking [here](https://store.birchwoodstudioandevents.com/Behringer_xtouch/Lighting/XtouchGrandMA2).
